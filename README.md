  ## Troubleshooting

  ### Copilot

  To use copilot, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
  If an error about the version of the node being too old appears, you may want to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and specifiy in `lua/config/lazy.lua` the location of the latest version you are using (latest line of the document).
